## Introduction 
This is a Java console application that simulates a coffee machine. 
It allows users to buy different types of coffee, refill the ingredients, take money from the machine, and view the current ingredient levels. 
Additionally, it provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

## Features -

* Buy Coffee: Users can choose from different types of coffee (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino) and purchase them. 
The coffee will only be dispensed if there are enough ingredients in the machine.

* Fill Ingredients: The maintainer can refill the coffee machine with water, milk, and coffee beans. 
The amounts are specified by the user.

* Take Money: The maintainer can collect the money from the machine's money box.

* Show Ingredients: Users can check the current levels of water, milk, coffee beans, and the amount of money in the machine.

* Analytics: The machine provides analytics on the number of coffees sold, total earnings, and ingredient consumption.

* Exit: Users can choose to exit the simulation.
